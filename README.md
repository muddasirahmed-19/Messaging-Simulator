Description:
A desktop-based chat simulator built using Python (Tkinter) that demonstrates the use of important Software Engineering design patterns including Factory, Builder, Decorator, Observer, and Singleton.  
This project was created as part of an semester assignment at the end of semester.

How it run the system:
1. Keep all python files in one folder
2. Open any compiler to debug and run python code (Visual studio is recommended)
3. Run the python file named as "app.py"
4. The application will open and will be ready to use

Dependencies:
1. Runtime: Whole project is written is python languege so the application is dependent on python 3.12
2. Tkinter: Tkinter comes built-in with Python. You don't need to install it. It provides the GUI components.

Folder Structure:
simple_chat/
├── app.py
├── builder.py
├── message_factory.py
├── message.py
├── decorator.py 
├── observer.py
├── chat_engine.py

Issues:
1. Only light theme
2. Works well only with given ratio(Application screen size)
